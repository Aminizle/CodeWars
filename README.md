    This repository is a showcase of my journey through Codewars, where each .js file represents one epic kata conquered.

   <h2>File Contents</h2>
   <p>Each file contains the following information:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Title of the kata</li>
      <li>Link to the kata on Codewars</li>
      <li>Instructions for the kata</li>
      <li>My solution to the kata</li>
      <li>Test cases for the kata</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Unit Testing and Reporting with Jest</h2>
   <p>Unit testing is a crucial part of software development that ensures the code works as expected and meets the requirements. In this repository, I have used Jest, a popular testing framework, to write unit tests for my solutions to the Codewars katas.</p>
   <p>To run the tests, you need to have Jest installed. You can install it using the following command:</p>


<pre><code>cd your-portfolio
npm install --save-dev jest
</code></pre>


   <p>After installing Jest, you can run the tests by executing the following command in the root directory of the project:</p>

<pre><code>cd your-portfolio
npm test
</code></pre>


   <p>Jest will then run all the test cases and provide a report of the test results. If any test cases fail, Jest will report the failure with detailed information to help you identify the issue and fix it.</p>
   <p>By using Jest for unit testing and reporting, I can ensure the quality and correctness of my solutions to the Codewars katas.</p>
